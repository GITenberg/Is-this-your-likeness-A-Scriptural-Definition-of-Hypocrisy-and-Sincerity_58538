SO SHALL WE ALSO BEAR THE</span> <span class="GutSmall">IMAGE OF
THE HEAVENLY.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great and excellent Mr. Toplady
remarks on painting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1.&nbsp; When a portrait painter takes a likeness,
there most be an <i>original</i> from whom to take it.&nbsp; Here
the original are God and Christ.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I awake up
after thy likeness,&rsquo; &amp;c.; and, we are
&ldquo;predestinated to be conformed to the image of his
Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The painter <i>changes</i> the materials on which he
will delineate his piece.&nbsp; There are paintings on wood, on
glass, on metals, on ivory, on canvass.&nbsp; So God
<i>chooses</i> and <i>selects</i> the persons, on whom his
uncreated spirit shall, with the pencil of effectual grace,
re-delineate that holy likeness which Adam lost.&nbsp; Among
these are some, whose natural capacities, and acquired
improvements, are not of the first-rate: there the image of God
is painted on <i>wood</i>.&nbsp; Others of God&rsquo;s people
have not those quick sensibilities, and poignant feelings, by
which many are distinguished: there the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
painting is on <i>marble</i>.&nbsp; Others are permitted to <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>fall from the
ardour of their first love, and to deviate from their
stedfastness: there the Holy Spirit paints on <i>glass</i>,
which, perhaps, the first stone of temptation may injure.&nbsp;
But the celestial Artist will, in time, repair those breaches,
and restore the frail brittle Christian, to his original
enjoyments, and to more than his original purity; and, what may
seem truly wonderful, divine grace restores the picture, by
breaking it over again.&nbsp; It is the broken-hearted sinner to
whom God will impart the comforts of salvation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The ancients painted only in <i>water-colours</i>;
but the moderns (from about A.D. 1320) have added beauty and
durability to their pictures, by painting them in
<i>oil</i>.&nbsp; Applicable to hypocrites and true
believers.&nbsp; An <i>hypocrite</i> may outwardly bear something
that resembles the image of God; but it is only in fresco, or
<i>water colours</i>, which do not last; and are, at best, laid
on by the hand of dissimulation.&nbsp; But (if I may accommodate
so familiar an idea to so high a subject) the Holy Spirit paints
in <i>oil</i>; he accompanies his work with unction and with
power, and hence it shall be crowned with honour, and praise, and
glory, at Christ&rsquo;s appearing.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; All pictures are <i>not of one size</i>.&nbsp; There
are various dimensions, from the miniature to the full
length.&nbsp; So in grace below.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; All pictures are <i>not framed alike</i>; some are
gilt, some are plain, and some have no frames at all.&nbsp;
Remember, that as the value of a picture does not depend on the
frame, but on the execution of the piece itself, so your
happiness and holiness does not depend on your outward station or
condition, but on the work of grace wrought in your soul by the
Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Some pictures are highly varnished; some not.&nbsp;
Some believers are learned, elegant and polite.&nbsp; Others, who
yet are believers still, want <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>those unessential
embellishments.&nbsp; See this contrasted in Mr. Hervey and Mr.
Bunyan, yet both shine alike in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; All pictures do not bear an <i>equally strong
resemblance</i> of their original.&nbsp; Nor are all Christians
equally conformed, at present, to Christ.&nbsp; In some, the
canvass is but preparing; they are only under the first drawings
of the Spirit.&nbsp; In others there are rude outlines, or a mere
sketch, not yet filled up: but the colours are preparing, and, in
due time, they will be laid on.&nbsp; Others are so far advanced,
that a few touches more will fit them for the skies.&nbsp; And
others, which are completely finished, are in heaven, to be part
of the living furniture of God&rsquo;s palace to all
eternity.&nbsp; And, what these are the rest shall be.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; A fine painting is <i>seldom finished at
once</i>.&nbsp; Successive sittings are usually required, and
repeated touches of the artist.&nbsp; Grace rarely does its work
all at once.&nbsp; The thief indeed, on the cross, received the
divine image at a single sitting; and in others, whom God may
call at the eleventh or even the twelfth hour, the work may be
cut short in righteousness.&nbsp; But, generally speaking, our
consummation in grace resembles the progress of a building, which
is gradually raised, and carried up from the foundation, part by
part.&nbsp; Rome was not built in a day.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; The <i>ground-work</i> of a picture undergoes a
<i>preparation</i> before the colours are superinduced.&nbsp; It
is washed, or cleared, or boiled in oil, according to the nature
of the material.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ere we are susceptible of the image
of the heavenly, the soul must experience a preparatory work of
conviction.&nbsp; Prejudices must be cleared away; enmity slain,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; To discern and admire the beauty of a picture, a
person must have three things&mdash;<i>eyes</i>, <i>light</i>,
and <i>taste</i>, (or a susceptibility of receiving <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>pleasure from a
beautiful object.)&nbsp; The world, spiritually speaking, want
all the three.&nbsp; Hence their hatred of God&rsquo;s
children.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Some Christians are like paintings in
<i>Mosaic</i>.&nbsp; They have somewhat almost of every thing,
except uniformity and consistency of conduct.&nbsp; But, when
their hearts come to be established with grace, they will be more
of a-piece; and, when in heaven, they will be all of a-piece.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; A number of heterogeneous, and seemingly
contradictory, ingredients are used by painters in mixing their
colours; but they are all useful, expedient, and necessary.&nbsp;
So are the various providences of God toward his people.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The providence of God having called me to a more intimate
acquaintance with the Lord&rsquo;s tried ones than falls to the
lot of ministers in general, I have long heard the voices of
their complaints and their fears; and amongst the rest has been
this&mdash;lest they should be nothing but hypocrites after all
their profession and experience; while with great grief I have
seen many who have no fears upon the subject, but appear to be
bold, hardened and presumptuous hypocrites.&nbsp; I determined,
by the Lord&rsquo;s assistance, in as clear and scriptural a
manner as I possibly could, to point out the sincere believer,
with all his feelings, frames, corruptions, infirmities, and
temptations, his falls, recoveries and conflicts, in direct
opposition to an hypocrite, in his attainment, confidence,
hardness, deceit and pride, that my reader may be able in looking
on these pictures to decide to which of these he
belongs&mdash;that the poor in spirit may be comforted, and the
hypocrite may, by divine light, discover himself and be made
sincere, is my humble aim.</p>
<p>In the many points in which these two differ would fill a
volume.&nbsp; I can only in this small <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>treatise shew some few guided by the
word of truth, in which it is impossible to err; and it is to be
lamented, that in the present state we cannot always find in the
course of our observation who <i>are</i> and who are <i>not</i>
either the one or the other.&nbsp; This can never be fully known
till that important period arrives spoken of by the prophet;
&ldquo;Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and
the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet for our own personal comfort and for the
honour of that grace that has made us sincere it is our business
to search for scriptural evidences of that sincerity, that we may
rejoice in that super-abounding which has made us to differ from
those who are awfully denominated hypocrites in Zion.&nbsp; The
best way to decide a character is by the word of God.&nbsp; Many
good men have written upon the subject, but some of them have
carried the subject too far and distressed the Lord&rsquo;s
tempted people.&nbsp; But, &ldquo;what saith the
scripture,&rdquo; should be our enquiry.&nbsp; This should decide
all subjects relative to character, whether sincere or
hypocritical.&nbsp; Let us notice what is said of such and take
no man&rsquo;s opinion besides.&nbsp; The terms hypocrite,
hypocrisy, hypocritical, hypocrites, occur thirty-five times in
the Bible, and not one text can possibly belong to the humble
broken-hearted sincere seeker of the friendship and favour of
God.&nbsp; I will quote all that is necessary, with one short
remark on them.&nbsp; Isaiah 32, vi.&mdash;&ldquo;His heart will
work iniquity to practice hypocrisy:&rdquo; these are those who
set forth false doctrine, worship and discipline, in opposition
to the truth as it is in Christ, to make men believe, they are
very holy, devout and religious; for it is added, &ldquo;to utter
error against the Lord:&rdquo; this is hypocrisy.&nbsp; Such are
also described in Isaiah 9, xvii.&mdash;Fearfulness, dread and
surprise shall seize such characters.&nbsp; Isaiah 33,
xix.&mdash;The <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>apostle Paul alludes to them.&nbsp; 1 Tim. iv.
2.&mdash;&ldquo;Speaking lies in hypocrisy;&rdquo; which plainly
by the connection refers to Anti-Christ, the man of sin, the
lying system of popery.&nbsp; But the wisdom which is from above
is pure and without hypocrisy.&nbsp; James 3, xvii.&nbsp; And the
apostle Peter well knowing the hypocrisy that is in the hearts of
real believers, exhorts to lay aside all dissembling among each
other, as unbecoming their genuine character.&mdash;1 Peter ii.
1.&nbsp; One of the awful threatenings pronounced against Israel
of old is this&mdash;&ldquo;I will send him against an
hypocritical nation,&rdquo; a people who professed the service of
God, but whose hearts were far from him, who in heart hated both
God, his ways, and his truths.&mdash;Isaiah x. 6.&nbsp; Such was
the degenerate state of that nation.&nbsp; &ldquo;For every one
is an hypocrite and an evil-doer.&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah ix.
17.&nbsp; In heart, haters of Christ.&nbsp; David met with such
in his time, and prophecied of their spite and hypocrisy to
Christ.&nbsp; Psalm xxxv. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;With hypocritical
mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their
teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which was fulfilled in the same abominable
characters; for the psalm belongs to Christ, and contains a
complaint of the conduct of the enemies of his person, mission,
miracles, work and truth.&nbsp; In Job&rsquo;s days there were
many; yea, congregations of them&mdash;the congregation of
hypocrites shall be desolate.&nbsp; These persons are also called
the tabernacles of bribery, who hope to bribe divine justice with
a few dead works of their own&mdash;too proud to submit to the
righteousness of the mediator&mdash;staying themselves on their
own supposed goodness, they hope to be saved in whole or in part
by it; &ldquo;but the hope of the hypocrite shall
perish.&rdquo;&mdash;Job viii. 19.&nbsp; And as he reject the
mediator between God and man, &ldquo;an hypocrite shall not come
before him.&rdquo;&mdash;Job xiii. 16.&nbsp; He may indeed
rejoice in his good name and false <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>confidence, but that lamp will be out
in death and leave him in possession of all his guilt
unpardoned.&nbsp; &ldquo;For what is the hope of the hypocrite
when God taketh him away, although he has gained the applause of
the world?&rdquo;&mdash;Job xxvii. 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;The joy of the
hypocrite is but for a moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Job xx. 5.&nbsp; And
every spiritual man who is divinely acquainted with the truth
shall oppose such characters and their false foundations.&nbsp;
Job xvii. 8&mdash;&ldquo;The innocent shall stir up himself
against the hypocrite.&rdquo;&nbsp; For as he is an hypocrite in
profession, in heart and in life, so also in the church and in
the world; for if a man is not sound in heart, towards God and
truth, he cannot be very sincere towards his neighbour; and
whence arise so much slander, backbiting and evil speaking in the
churches but from such characters.&nbsp; These troubled the
churches in the apostles&rsquo; days.&nbsp; Paul, Peter, James,
John and Jude bore their testimony against them; for &ldquo;an
hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his
neighbour.&rdquo;&mdash;Prov. xi. 9.&nbsp; And although many such
may be in great power, and have obtained that dignity either in a
nation or in the church, by their pretended humanity, care and
tenderness towards a people, as Absalom did, when he rose up in
rebellion against his father, and by a pretended affection for
the people, and speedily vindicating their cause&mdash;yet he
reigned not long.&nbsp; Job xxxix. 3&mdash;That the hypocrite
reign not, lest the people be ensnared.&nbsp; Such in a
profession got into the churches of Corinth and Galatea, and was
no small affliction to the mind of Paul; for by artful
insinuations they raised a prejudice in the minds of the churches
against the very apostle who had been the means of their
conversion.&nbsp; Thus, like their father, the devil, they did
his work first by insinuation, (for a whisperer separateth chief
friends) and then more openly; but I would they were cut off that
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>trouble
you.&nbsp; Let not the hypocrite reign lest the people be
ensnared, which was the case in both churches, and is the very
case at the present day.&nbsp; Nearly twenty times in the New
Testament our Saviour accused the Pharisees of hypocrisy, because
they were really hypocrites, and nothing else.&nbsp; The word,
according to the learned, comes from the Greek,
<i>hypocrisis</i>, it is counterfeiting religion and
virtue&mdash;an affectation of the name and hatred to the
thing&mdash;the having the form of godliness but denying the
power.&nbsp; Thus, he is an hypocrite who pretends to be what he
is not&mdash;who puts on a false person like the actor in tragedy
or comedy&mdash;as a beggar may act a king, or a coward an
hero.&nbsp; But the chief enemies our dear Lord had were the
Pharisees, whose characters are drawn by an unerring hand; they
imposed many severe injunctions, rites and ceremonies above what
the law required; but they never did the least part of them
themselves.&nbsp; What they did was only for ostentation to be
seen of men; they hid their crying sins, under the appearance of
virtue, that they might sin with less suspicion.&nbsp; Whited
sepulchres, within nothing but sordid dust.&nbsp; They were exact
in trifling matters&mdash;zealous in all outward forms of
religious worship, but totally neglected all acts of justice,
mercy and truth; they studied an external purity of hands, pots
and dishes, but strangers to heart-felt purity; they pretended a
deal of respect to the ancient prophets, who were faithful to God
and truth, yet hated, persecuted and murdered the God of the
prophets.&nbsp; On them in one chapter the Saviour pronounced
eight awful woes&mdash;told them of their dreadful end&mdash;the
destruction of their temple and city&mdash;and then left that
place for ever.&nbsp; Hypocrites are said to pray only to God in
the time of sickness: and will God hear their cry?&nbsp;
No&mdash;the foolish virgins, after their long profession, cried
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;Lord, Lord, open, to us:&rdquo; but the Lord
would not hear.</p>
<p>Having stated what the scripture says of hypocrites and
hypocrisy, I only appeal to any humbly enlightened
believer&mdash;what has such a definition of character to do with
one is in any degree taught of God, is blessed with the fear of
God, has fled for refuge to the atonement and righteousness of
Christ, and who is most sincerely seeking, longing, looking, and
waiting for the manifestation of his love, favour and
goodwill.&nbsp; I must say to such dejected ones, as Elihu to
Job&mdash;&ldquo;Although though sayest I shall not see him, yet
judgment is before him, therefore trust thou in him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That there have been hypocrites in the church in all ages is very
evident.&nbsp; Cain got into the first&mdash;Ham in Noah&rsquo;s
family&mdash;Ishmael and Esau into the next&mdash;Corah, Dathan,
Abiram, Nadab, and Abihu in the camp of Israel&mdash;Saul and
Ahithophel in David&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Solomon detected, and in
his writings exposed many Judas amongst the apostles.&nbsp;
Alexander Hymenus, Philetus, Hermogenes and Demas, with many
false apostles and deceitful workers in Paul&rsquo;s days.&nbsp;
But this argues nothing against the religion of the Son of God;
and although ignorant and carnal persons pretend to object to
religion, because so many hypocrites profess it&mdash;this very
objection proves such persons to be hypocrites themselves.&nbsp;
What, would any man throw away a handful of good silver because
he had found one bad shilling amongst them?&nbsp; The carnal mind
is enmity, but too proud to own it; and all the outcry raised by
the carnal world is merely designed to conceal the wretched
enmity of their hearts to the truth as it is in Christ.</p>
<p>A question has been asked, can a person be an hypocrite and
not know it?&nbsp; I answer, no, by no means.&nbsp; Did not Saul
know he was acting the hypocrite in his concession to
David?&nbsp; Did not <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Judas know that he was planning to
sell the Savour&rsquo;s blood at the very time he eating the
passover with him, and hearing his most heavenly
discourses?&nbsp; Did not Jacob know he was deceiving his Father,
when he said, &ldquo;I am thy son Esau?&rdquo;&nbsp; Did not
David know that he was not mad, when he pretended to be so to
save his life?&nbsp; Every person can tell, whether they most
sincerely desire, from a feeling sense of need, a sense of
pardoning mercy, and the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s favour; or
whether they profess religion for any other purpose, let it be
what it will.&nbsp; It is to be lamented that many sincere
characters have been guilty of hypocritical actions, and yet be
sincere.&nbsp; Witness Abraham, Jacob, David and others.&nbsp; So
also may hypocrites do many praise-worthy actions, and yet be
hypocrites.&nbsp; Such are not real members, but mere
excressences of the Church like falling hair or the parings of
the nail.&nbsp; When Satan suggests to a believer, he is nothing
but an hypocrite, his only remedy is by prayer and supplication
to God, to make him sincere&mdash;and as to the world charging
him with being an hypocrite, because they have fallen out with
him, they are no judges neither of sincerity nor hypocrisy, only
let us before God, the Church and the world, walk as consistently
as possible, and let dogs bark on nor heed their howlings, the
love of Christ in the heart will suffer that</p>
<blockquote><p>She nor desires, nor seeks to know<br />
The scandals of the time;<br />
Nor look with pride on those below,<br />
Nor envy those that climb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of our old divines has reckoned up thirty-two different
species of hypocrites, and if there are as many thousand, it is
an awful proof that the heart is deceitful above all things, and
desperately wicked.&nbsp; Who but God knows it?&nbsp; But that
the professing Church abound with it, is too evident; for
instance:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>How
many can shape their religion according to the times, like the
Vicar of Bray; he was a Papist in the reign of Henry VIII; when
the nation turned Protestant, the vicar turned also; when queen
Mary came to the throne he turned Papist, and after her death and
Elizabeth succeeded, he turned Protestant again; and being
questioned about it, he said, he had nothing to do but with his
vicarage&mdash;Vicar of Bray I was, Vicar of Bray I am, and Vicar
of Bray I will be, whatever king reign.&nbsp; Such alas, we
should find hundreds, were such changes again to take place in
civil and ecclesiastical affairs.&nbsp; But are not such
hypocrites?&nbsp; When a church clergyman swears to the doctrinal
articles of that church, and declares he is moved by the Holy
Ghost to take upon him that office, and yet hates some of the
leading doctrines, and ridicules the work of God, the Holy
Spirit, upon the hearts of men as enthusiasm, he is an
hypocrite.&nbsp; When Dissenters, Independents, or Baptists
profess Calvinism, yet are shy of the doctrines of truth, and
swerve to the system of Arminianism, they are hypocrites.&nbsp;
When such profest Calvinists sneeringly treat the grand doctrines
of truth, as high doctrines, and thereby raise prejudices in the
minds of their hearers against the truth as mere high notions,
and those that preach it, they are hypocrites.&nbsp; When
ministers accommodate their sermons to different sects and
parties, to please men contrary to conscience, they are
hypocrites.&nbsp; This reminds me of an anecdote, too true it is
to be feared, when a minister came to a certain town to preach,
one of the managers of the chapel visited him, and told him, he
hoped he would not be very high in his sentiments; because, added
he, you will see an old gentlemen in such a seat with a gold
headed cane&mdash;he cannot bear the doctrine of the
Trinity.&nbsp; And in another pew sits an old lady with a <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>muff, she
hates the doctrine of election, and as they are great subscribers
to the place, it is a pity to offend them.&nbsp; And besides, you
know, Sir, you can preach about a good many things besides.&nbsp;
To comply to such Pharisees is the most arrant hypocrisy, and the
man that would thus accommodate such, is an <span
class="smcap">Hypocrite</span>.</p>
<p>Taking up the ministry, for a piece of bread, for popularity,
for respect, for a rich wife, or for any sordid purposes, such
persons are <span class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>Setting out in the ministry with sound truth, but sound truth
becoming unpopular, and with a view to avoid reproach, as an
Antinomian in principle, mingling grace and works, law and
gospel, Calvinism and Arminianism, to keep up the name of being
reputable, is <span class="smcap">Hypocrisy</span>.</p>
<p>Persons coming into a profession, taking up religion for
connection, trade, or for any other profit in temporal things, is
an <span class="smcap">Hypocrite</span>.</p>
<p>Pleading for holiness, morality, duty and consistency; yet
living in secret sin, as his real element, though unknown to
others, is an <span class="smcap">Hypocrite</span>.</p>
<p>Searching out, spreading abroad, scandalizing, and rejoicing
in the real or supposed falls, sins and infirmities of others, to
cover their own sins, such are <span
class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>Pretenders to universal love to all, at the same time haters
of truth, those who preach it boldly, and profess it sincerely,
are <span class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>Making an outcry against one sin and living in another, for
instance, a covetous professor may storm against the sin of
drunkenness; why, because he loves his money so
inordinately&mdash;yet will not scruple to drink occasionally a
little too much at another person&rsquo;s expence, this is <span
class="smcap">Hypocrisy</span>.</p>
<p>Persons who would almost starve a wife, children, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>servants, and
apprentices at home, to gain money, that they may have a good
name by subscribing liberally to religious or civil society, are
<span class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>But, alas! there is no end to the hypocrisy of the human
heart.&nbsp; The only cure is grace enabling a man to set God
always before him, and cause him daily to walk in simplicity and
godly sincerity&mdash;thus to have his conversation in this
world.&nbsp; I once more remark, when professors gives themselves
up to idleness, going from house to house, busy-bodies in other
men&rsquo;s matters, presume upon the providence of God, and
boast that they live by faith&mdash;that this promise, and the
other, has been applied to them, and so expect to be fed as
Elijah was by the ravens, such mumping professors, are <span
class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>When persons unhumbled, unrenewed by grace, suddenly leap up
into full assurance of faith, without any chastening from the law
or tenderness of conscience, a few scraps of divinity in the
head, and at the same time treat with contempt the meek, the
dejected, the broken-hearted seeker, thinking lightly of
contrition, godly sorrow and repentance, unto life or obedience
of faith, such are <span class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>When a person, whether a public or private character,
scandalizes another on account, or rather envying his fame,
usefulness or popularity, taking every opportunity to degrade his
person, actions, or reputation, although unknown to the
calumniator, he is an <span class="smcap">Hypocrite</span>.</p>
<p>Those who pretend much love to God, while he is pleased to
bless them in providence, but leave their profession when God is
pleased to cross them, such are like children won with an apple
and lost with a nut, such love is soon kindled and soon quenched,
turn enemies to God and his truths when their expectations fail,
such are <span class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>When
persons profess much love to a minister or fellow member in the
church, while in prosperous circumstances, but when trouble,
persecution, disgrace, disrepute or poverty befal them, they know
them no more, like the cuckoo who will abide with you during the
summer, but when winter approaches, will take his leave of you,
nor perhaps, ever own you again.&nbsp; Ah! how unlike the love of
Christ.&nbsp; In general you will find such to be <span
class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>When persons shun those sins that would bring on them public
scandal, and at the same time in love with secret sins, and spare
these, because no one knows it, thinking small sins, if not
known, will do no harm, yet making a sad outcry against sin,
especially the sins of their neighbours, such are <span
class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>When persons boast and are proud of their own holy motives,
sincerity of heart, holiness of life, purity of conduct, and a
good name in the world, while destitute of the pardon of their
sins, destitute of the faith of God&rsquo;s elect, whereby the
righteousness of Christ is received, destitute of the sanctifying
teaching of the Holy Spirit, such are <span
class="smcap">Hypocrites</span>.</p>
<p>But while we view the wretched state and character of the
hypocrite, as set forth in God&rsquo;s word, may we not pray in
the devout language of David.&mdash;&ldquo;Who can understand his
error; cleanse thou me from my secret faults; keep back also thy
servant from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over
me; so shall I be innocent from the great
transgression.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as expressed in the Litany of the
Church of England&mdash;&ldquo;and from all hypocrisy, good Lord
deliver us.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hypocrite thus painted to the life,
we cannot err in the description; many have been painted by
others very differently, and many have painted themselves, and
sat down to admire their likenesses; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>but though painted like Jezebel at
the window (2 Kings ix. 30), or their own righteousness like the
houses of the great painted with vermilion, or the hypocrites in
the times of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and in our Lord&rsquo;s
day&mdash;Jeremiah xxii. 14&mdash;Ezekiel xxiii. 40&mdash;Matthew
vi. 16.&nbsp; Yet the Lord has threatened that his hand should be
upon all such pleasant pictures&mdash;Isaiah ii. 16&mdash;and
that he would despise their image because it is not the image of
Christ, which consists in righteousness, knowledge and true
holiness.&nbsp; The real likeness of God&rsquo;s sincere ones is
drawn by the same unerring hand.</p>
<p>I bless God it is not left to the opinions of men; and should
I attempt it, no doubt it would meet with severe criticisms from
some, and mere cant from others; for a writer
observes&mdash;&ldquo;of all the cants which are canted in this
canting world, the cant of hypocrisy is the worst.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yet the cant of criticism is the most tormenting.&nbsp; I say not
this because I am afraid of advancing any truth for fear of
censure; no, I consider censure to be the tax that every public
character has to pay to the public if he is in any way
useful.&nbsp; I have often been grieved in reading the lives of
good men, written in such a strain as if they were truly perfect
in thought, word and deed, quite holy and unblameable in every
thing.&nbsp; This is not the method the Holy Spirit has
adopted&mdash;in the word, the graces, and the failings, the
falls and the renewings, the sighs, and the songs of his people
are well drawn by the pencil of truth.&nbsp; What they are in
Adam the first, and what they are in Christ is clearly
delineated.&nbsp; But with all the infirmities they possess it is
a mercy the Holy Spirit has made them truly <i>sincere</i>; and
this the apostle prays for&mdash;&ldquo;that ye may be
<i>sincere</i> and without offence in the day of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And under this divine influence he rejoices
that in all simplicity <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and godly <i>sincerity</i> he had his
conversation in the world; and hence that important exhortation
of pious Joshua, &ldquo;only fear the Lord in <i>sincerity</i>
and truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the apostle also exhorts the
Lord&rsquo;s people to keep the gospel feast in <i>sincerity</i>,
and to remember the Lord&rsquo;s poor, as a proof their love was
<i>sincere</i> towards the Lord; to whom also he wishes much
grace and peace, even to all them that love our Lord Jesus in
<i>sincerity</i>.&nbsp; And as an ornament, yea, a principal
qualification of an elder, he mentions in doctrine shewing
gravity, <i>sincerity</i>, and as new-born babes desire the
<i>sincere</i> milk of the word, that they may grow
thereby&mdash;not only the word but the milk of the word, that
they may grow in knowledge, faith and love.</p>
<p>The word sincerity signifies uprightness and truth.&nbsp;
Sincerity is opposed to double mindfulness, when the sentiments
of the heart are contrary to the language of the month.&nbsp; The
language of Baalam in blessing the Israelites was quite the
reverse of his heart&mdash;he would most gladly have cursed them
for the wages of iniquity; and, like Joab who took Abner aside to
speak quietly to him but smote him under the fifth rib that he
died; and like Judas, with &ldquo;Hail master,&rdquo; and kissed
him and betrayed him into the hands of his enemies.&nbsp; But
while this is the case with the hypocrite, God has blest his own
children as they are regenerated with <i>sincerity</i> of
principle, <i>sincerity</i> of pursuit, and in their general
deportment <i>sincerity</i> of action.&nbsp; This is the genuine
work of the Holy Spirit, the Lord and giver of life, who is well
acquainted with the persons of God&rsquo;s elect, who were chosen
in Christ before the foundation of the world, and predestinated
to the adoption of sons&mdash;to know their sonship in this
world, and to be publicly owned by their ever adorable Father
before assembled worlds&mdash;eternally united to Christ as the
Great Head of the <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Church, viewed in him complete; and according to the
well ordered covenant of grace, brought into a state of pardon, a
state of peace and reconciliation, a state of justification and
acceptance with God in Christ, <i>by</i> Christ, <i>through</i>
Christ, and <i>for</i> Christ.&nbsp; The ever-adorable most holy
God the Spirit graciously undertook to be their teacher, to take
eternal possession of them, to be in them as a well of water
springing up to eternal life&mdash;illuminating their minds,
quickening their souls with a principle of life, subduing their
sins, shewing them the salvation that there is in Christ, and at
times giving them power to enjoy it&mdash;this holy principle
which makes its possessor <i>sincere</i> is sometimes denominated
faith, and it is faith unfeigned&mdash;sometimes it is called
love, and it is love without dissimulation; and let the believer
be in whatever frame he may, he is still blessed with these in
their degree&mdash;these produce humble fear, holy desires, great
anxiety, godly sorrow, fervent breathings, self abasement,
spiritual meekness, holy obedience, love to all the truth and to
those that love it&mdash;and if a person is in possession of
these, he is truly made by grace <i>sincere</i>.&nbsp; What he is
as a sinner he well knows, nor will ever alter his opinion of
himself.&nbsp; Many deluded ones may fancy their sinful nature is
getting better, but while such rise in awful pride, the
<i>sincere</i> believer sinks lower and lower in his own
estimation in proportion as his spiritual knowledge
increases.&nbsp; Knowledge and humility are twins in the
believer&rsquo;s mind, and those who are thus favoured can never
be barren&mdash;Song iv. 2.&nbsp; In a state of nature
God&rsquo;s elect in general differ nothing from the greatest
reprobate neither in principle nor conduct&mdash;they are
enemies, ungodly, proud, boasters, haters, malicious and slaves
to Satan, the flesh, the world and sin.&nbsp; Of <i>this</i> the
Holy Spirit convinces them&mdash;of <i>this</i> they are
ashamed&mdash;for <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span><i>this</i> they feel condemned by the holy law of
God&mdash;from <i>this</i> they are turned, and being convinced
they feel their need of a Saviour, a surety, a better
righteousness than their own, this makes them <i>sincere</i> in
their pursuits.&nbsp; To such as these the Lord
speaks&mdash;&ldquo;Hearken unto me ye that follow after
righteousness, ye that seek the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as they
follow after righteousness so they are said to follow holiness,
to follow the Lamb who is both the righteousness and the holiness
of his church, and are made sincere by grace.&nbsp; In this
pursuit they will not rest.&nbsp; To such as these the gospel
invitation is given, even to the <i>poor</i>, who are convinced
that they are not able to pay the demands of the law halt, who
through temptation, unbelief, and erroneous characters, waver in
their minds about some of the great truths of God&mdash;lame and
maimed feel their own weakness, helplessness, wounded in spirit,
nor can they get on in the divine life&mdash;<i>blind</i> about
their interest in Christ for a season.&nbsp; Such are those who
<i>sincerely</i> know themselves to be what God declares have a
right to all the precious privileges of the gospel.&nbsp; And it
is such as these the Lord has pronounced blessed in his sermon on
the mount in eight particulars; as the poor in spirit emptied of
all supposed goodness in themselves, mourning in mind on account
of sin and abused goodness&mdash;meek, humble, docile, teachable,
hungry and thirsty, which includes sensations of pain, desire and
pursuit&mdash;merciful to the souls, bodies, and names of
others&mdash;pure in heart by receiving the atonement and by the
indwelling of the spirit&mdash;and the word peace-makers in the
church&mdash;loving to those who belong to God&mdash;hating
variance, strife, and pride, persecuted for imputed and imparted
righteousness-sake, for decidedness in the cause of
Christ&mdash;though reviled, yet falsely, such have their reward
in heavenly smiles now and to all eternity in a <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>better
world&mdash;these are those who are sincere&mdash;chastened,
tempted, tossed, dejected, broken in nature by the fall, and in
heart by grace, sorrowing on account of sin and over a suffering
Saviour.&nbsp; To those who are so <i>sincerely</i> tried the
Saviour opened his commission in the synagogue, taking his sweet
text from Isaiah&mdash;&ldquo;The spirit of the Lord God is upon
me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor;
he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance
to captives and the opening of the prison doors to those that are
bound, to set at liberty those that are bruised, to comfort all
that mourn.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are characters to whom Christ can
only be precious&mdash;the whole in their own estimation need him
not.&nbsp; I came not to call such but sinners to repentance; and
being called into a state of repentance, that grace will flow
sweetly when love, mercy and goodness is felt.&nbsp; This is the
Holy Spirit&rsquo;s description of those that are
<i>sincere</i>.&nbsp; He has condescended to exhibit their
likeness, that we may see our own.&nbsp; This is an act of
stupendous condescension; and taking this scriptural view, we can
bless the grace that has made us to differ from the Pharisee and
the hypocrite.&nbsp; Oh, to grace how great a debtor!&nbsp; Daily
I rejoice to be&mdash;and in the fine language of the communion
of the church of England, would daily pray&mdash;</p>
<p>Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known,
and from whom no secrets are hid, cleanse the thoughts of our
hearts by the inspiration of thy Holy Spirit, that we may
perfectly (sincerely) love thee, and worthily magnify thy holy
name, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Every one
that God has made honest in heart can say amen to this
prayer.</p>
<p>I remark once more, that the Lord&rsquo;s people are in
scripture called believers, because they are blessed with the
faith of God&rsquo;s elect.&nbsp; Here they <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>are made
<i>sincere</i>.&nbsp; Faith is a giving credit to what God says
in his word, and is perfectly satisfied with his truth, with the
record God has given of his Son.&nbsp; It is also a divine
persuasion the soul is persuaded of the love, grace, and
faithfulness of God&mdash;<i>it</i> rests on what God says, and
is seen in its actings, which we sometimes call
exercises&mdash;<i>it</i> flies to Christ in danger, sin, trouble
and threatenings&mdash;<i>it</i> leans upon Christ amidst all
weakness and sore darkness&mdash;<i>it</i> trusts in the person
and work of Christ for pardon, justification, and holiness, for
comfort, knowledge, support, help and deliverance&mdash;<i>it</i>
pleads with Christ upon the ground of his promises, and appears
before God only in Christ; and this faith is the work of God upon
the soul&mdash;<i>it</i> evidences a person&rsquo;s salvation,
and sooner or later such persons shall most sensibly enjoy the
smiles of a covenant God, the light of his countenance, and the
fullest persuasion of his love.&nbsp; When these are seen and
felt it is sense&mdash;but when they are not, then it is the
business of faith to be looking out of self to Jesus, to be
waiting on him and for him; and here also hope is
engaged&mdash;it is expecting the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s
promises, nor shall such wait, look or hope in vain.&nbsp; We
find even hope blessed in this exercise.</p>
<blockquote><p>For Lord if thou ne&rsquo;er had&rsquo;st
design&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No covenant blessing for me,<br />
Ah, tell me how is it I find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such sweetness in waiting for thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as faith and hope are thus engaged as soon as the Lord
appears, to our joy so love and rapturous joy and thankfulness
follow.&nbsp; We love him because he first loved us.&nbsp; I will
love thee, O Lord my strength&mdash;I love the Lord because he
hath heard the voice of my supplication&mdash;she loved much
because much was forgiven, and here repentance flows as divine
love is felt&mdash;repentance is the tear of love dropping from
the eye of faith; <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>and in these feelings how sweet is obedience&mdash;we
can <i>run</i> the way of his commandments when his love enlarges
the heart, but when it does not, then, wait I say on the Lord,
till power is felt again rising and falling, ebbing and flowing,
running and waiting in the spirit of our minds, is the road the
Lord leads his people in a time state; and it is a mercy to know
that the Lord has fulfilled that precious truth in us&mdash;thy
people shall be willing in the day of thy power, for this
evidences us to be his chosen people according to his word, and
we need no clearer testimony.&nbsp; Conscience can bear witness
when the blessed spirit gives fresh light, that these things
which I have written have been and now are carrying on in the
souls of those who are called by the grace of God; and surely he
that hath begun the good work will carry it on till it is
consummated in glory.&nbsp; But this we know also, that a daily
cross dead weights, powerful besetting sins, heaviness and
despondency, a tempting devil, many cares and snares, losses and
crossed darkness, weakness, stupefaction, and reluctance to all
that is good&mdash;stormy days and dismal nights must be the lot
of all who are taught of God.&nbsp; The old man of sin and Satan
working upon it, will often cause the sad outcry of&mdash;Oh,
wretched man that I am, for the good I would I do not, and the
evil in thought word or deed I would not, that at times do
I.&nbsp; Blessed be God however, in our worst moments Satan
cannot rob us of this <i>will</i> to do that which is good; and
most <i>sincerely</i></p>
<p>I would believe unceasingly,</p>
<p>I would hope always firmly,</p>
<p>I would confide steadily,</p>
<p>I would love the sacred Trinity supremely,</p>
<p>I would be patient without a murmur,</p>
<p>I would commune with Christ at all times,</p>
<p>I would resist the devil always,</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>I would
deny self continually,</p>
<p>I would fly from every sin,</p>
<p>I would hear without wandering,</p>
<p>I would pray without ceasing,</p>
<p>I would be always giving of thanks,</p>
<p>I would universally promote the Redeemer&rsquo;s cause,</p>
<p>I would ever plead for his truth,</p>
<p>I would be always kind to his poor,</p>
<p>I would bring in the whole world to adore him,</p>
<p>I would get home this moment to see him,</p>
<p>I would have an increasing knowledge of him,</p>
<p>I would be overcome with his love,</p>
<p>I would bless him for what he is in himself,</p>
<p>I would be holy as an angel of light.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
